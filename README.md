# BDDMP

**DISCLAMER: This is a fork of dsonbills code and most of te credit goes to him, I just patched it and begun work on tracers**

This is an addon to [DMP](https://github.com/godarklight/DarkMultiPlayer) that enables the use of [BD Armoury's](https://github.com/BahamutoD/BDArmory) weapons in multiplayer

~~This requires a fork of BD Armoury [Here](https://github.com/jediminer543/BDArmory) to work properly (it adds hooks to damage effects to allow for transfer)~~

Not any more, the code now uses detours

To compile, chuck all dependances (DLL's of DarkMultiPlayer, BDA, and KSP/Managed/) into External
